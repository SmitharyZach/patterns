# Patterns

Patterns is a web app designed to help the user track and manage their overall well-being and daily habits.

## Goal
To build a web app utilizing backend development skills.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Cascading Style Sheets(CSS] (https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css)

## How it Works

Users can create an account and login to their dashboard. They will be able to enter their daily habits. 

The app will create a daily summary of their habits. 

## Problems During Development

*Conflicts can occur often when code reviewing pull requests. It's important for all contributors to be current with master so when local changes are pushed into the repo, manual corrections can be kept to a minimum.
